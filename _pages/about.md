I am a PhD Student in the Software Practices Lab at UBC, supervised by William J. Bowman.
My research focuses on doing compiler optimizations safely.
My interests include the theory and practice of types and compilers, especially problems related to practical type preservation.
I also have experience working on program verification projects, which is something I enjoy.

Outside of grad school, I referee fencing on the US and Canadian national circuits (I also fence, but not nationally).
I have a cat, Socrates.
I enjoy cooking and baking, when I have time/energy.
My time is often wasted watching various sports, TV shows, and movies.
